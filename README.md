# snowreport
## Initial Ideas
- multi graph webpage shwoing current snow recordings and snow depth in certain areas of colorado.
- each graph will be a station where the snow levels have been recorded.
- Possibly have a few stations showing the last 15 minute precipitation numbers for a real time pow level meeter.
